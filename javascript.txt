var used for old browser support.
let from 2015 onwards.
const (value, datatype not to be changed)

variables like

let a;

a will have undefined value.


variables like:

var a = 0;
var a;

a will still have 0.

You can redeclare only with var keyword, not with
let and const.


$ is allowed in variable names.

variables declared with let inside block can't be used
outside block but declared with var keyword can
be used


var x = 2;   // Allowed
let x = 3;   // Not allowed

{
let x = 2;   // Allowed
let x = 3;   // Not allowed
}


JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
{
let x = 2;   // Allowed
var x = 3;   // Not allowed
}
